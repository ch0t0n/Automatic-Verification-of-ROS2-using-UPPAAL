# Automatic-Verification-of-ROS2-using-UPPAAL
This project is about automatically convert a ROS model into UPPAAL model to verify system-wide time-critical properties using timed automata. The two example models are given in example_ros_model.txt and kobuki_model.txt. Just run the ROS_Model_to_TA.py to run it by taking these text files as inputs.
